## Istaa theme

Currently using Foundation 6.3.1.

### Pre-baked with all of the great features that are found in the Foundation framework – simply put, if it works in Foundation, it will work in Istaa. The theme also includes:

- Foundation Navigation Options
- Motion-UI
- Grid archive templates
- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support
- And much, much more!

### What tools do I need to use?
You can use whatever you want – seriously. While the Sass version comes with Bower and Gulp support out of the box, you aren’t required to use those by any means. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It’s completely up to you how you decide to build you theme – JointsWP won’t get in the way of your workflow.
